                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a dedicated professional with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. 
                    As a veteran and disabled service member, I bring a unique perspective shaped by years of discipline, 
                    responsibility, and commitment to excellence in everything I do.

                <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    With over two decades of experience in the technology and IT sectors, I've had the opportunity to work 
                    across diverse industries—from healthcare to software development to government services. My career has been 
                    defined by my ability to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders, ensuring that 
                    complex technical solutions align with real-world business needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My expertise spans system analysis, application security, network operations, and project leadership. 
                    I take pride in my methodical approach to problem-solving and my ability to translate technical jargon 
                    into clear, actionable insights that teams can understand and execute.

                <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm motivated by the opportunity to create meaningful solutions that make a tangible difference. Whether 
                    I'm automating workflows to improve efficiency, securing critical systems, or leading teams to deliver 
                    quality software, I focus on understanding the underlying business problem before jumping to solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in continuous growth and improvement—both personally and professionally. Throughout my career, 
                    I've pursued advanced degrees and certifications to stay current with evolving technologies and best practices. 
                    Currently, I'm expanding my skills in web development and full-stack programming to broaden my technical capabilities.

                <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
                <p>

                    that interest me, and maintaining a commitment to personal wellness. My background as a veteran has instilled 
                    in me a strong sense of service and community responsibility.
